# Rust configuration for MAXIMUM x86_64 compatibility
# Use the most conservative settings possible to avoid "Illegal instruction" errors
# This is for CI x86_64 Linux builds, not cross-compilation

[build]
# Let cargo use the native target but with conservative flags

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# Use only baseline x86_64 instruction set (SSE/SSE2 only)
# Disable all optional/newer instruction sets for maximum compatibility
