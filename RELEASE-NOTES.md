  * `snow snowpark package create`

## Fixes and improvements

* Adding `--image-name` option for image name argument in `spcs image-repository list-tags` for consistency with other commands.

* Snowpark changes
  * Removed `procedure` and `function` subgroups.
  * Removed `snow snowpark function package` and `snow snowpark procedure package` in favour of `snow snowpark build`.

  * Removed `snow snowpark procedure create` and `snow snowpark procedure update`. Procedures can be deployed using `snow snowpark deploy`.
  * Procedures and functions use single zip artifact for all functions and procedures in project.
  * Changed path to coverage reports on stage, previously created procedures with coverage will not work, have to be recreated.
  * Previously created procedures or functions won't work with `deploy` command due to change in stage path of artifact. Previous code will remain under old path on stage.

* Snowpark Containers services commands
  * `cp` alias for `compute-pool` commands was removed.
  * `services` commands were renamed to `service`
  * `registry` commands were renamed to `image-registry`
  * `compute-pool`, `service`, and `image-registry` commands were moved from `snowpark` group to a new `spcs` group.
  * `snow spcs compute-pool create` and `snow spcs service create` have been updated with new options to match SQL interface.
  * Added new `image-repository` command group under `spcs`. Moved `list-images` and `list-tags` from `image-registry` to `image-repository`.
  * Removed `snow snowpark jobs` command.
  * `list-images` and `list-tags` now outputs image names with a slash at the beginning (e.g. /db/schema/repo/image). Image name input to `list-tags` requires new format.
  * `snow spcs compute-pool stop` has been removed in favor of `snow spcs compute-pool stop-all`.

* Streamlit changes
  * `snow streamlit deploy` is requiring `snowflake.yml` project file with a Streamlit definition.
  * `snow streamlit describe` is now `snow object describe streamlit`
  * `snow streamlit list` is now `snow object list streamlit`
  * `snow streamlit drop` is now `snow object drop streamlit`

* Added support for runtime version in snowpark procedures ad functions.
* You can include previously uploaded packages in your functions, by listing them under `imports` in `snowflake.yml`
* Added more options to `snow connection add` - now you can also specify authenticator and path to private key
* Added support for native applications by introducing new commands.
  * `snow app init` command that creates a new Native App project from a git repository as a template.
  * `snow app version create` command that creates or upgrades an application package and creates a version or patch for that package.
  * `snow app version drop` command that drops a version associated with an application package.
  * `snow app version list` command that lists all versions associated with an application package.

* Snowpark: add `default` field to procedure and function arguments definition in `snowflake.yml` to support [named and optional
  arguments](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/udf-calling-sql#calling-a-udf-that-has-optional-arguments)
