# Fedora Quick Start Guide - Debug Build

This guide helps you quickly deploy and run the Snowflake CLI debug build on a remote Fedora system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Architecture Compatibility

**The debug binary must be built on the same architecture as your target system.** If you built on macOS/ARM64 but are deploying to Linux/x86_64, you'll get "not in executable format" errors.

**Recommended Solution:** Use `--build-remote` to build directly on your Fedora system.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Build on Remote System (‚≠ê Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy source code and build on the remote system
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh --build-remote user@your-fedora-server.com

# SSH to your server and start debugging
ssh user@your-fedora-server.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
gdb ./dist/snow-debug/snow-debug
```

### Option 2: RPM Package (Professional/Enterprise)

```bash
# Build debug RPM package
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-rpm

# Install the RPM package
sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/snowflake-cli-debug-*.rpm

# Debug the installed package
gdb /usr/bin/snow-debug
```

For complete RPM packaging instructions, see **[FEDORA_RPM_DEBUG.md](FEDORA_RPM_DEBUG.md)**.

### Option 3: Deploy Pre-built Binary (Only if architectures match)

```bash
# Only use this if your local machine and remote system have the same architecture
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh user@your-fedora-server.com

# SSH to your server and start debugging
ssh user@your-fedora-server.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
gdb ./snow-debug
```

### Option 4: Manual Setup

```bash
# Deploy only the setup files
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh --setup-only user@your-fedora-server.com

# SSH to your server and complete setup manually
ssh user@your-fedora-server.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
./setup_fedora_debug.sh

# Clone and build the project
git clone https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-cli.git
cd snowflake-cli
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

## üìã Prerequisites

### On Your Local Machine
- SSH access to the remote Fedora system
- This repository cloned locally
- Basic build tools (for Option 1)

### On Remote Fedora System
- Fedora 35+ (tested)
- Sudo access for installing packages
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

## üîß Deployment Options

### Basic Deployment
```bash
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh user@fedora-server.com
```

### With Custom SSH Port
```bash
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh -p 2222 user@fedora-server.com
```

### With SSH Key
```bash
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@fedora-server.com
```

### Custom Destination
```bash
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh -d /opt/snowflake-cli user@fedora-server.com
```

### Build on Remote System
```bash
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh --build-remote user@fedora-server.com
```

## üêõ Using GDB on Fedora

Once deployed, you can debug the CLI:

### Basic GDB Usage
```bash
# Start GDB with the debug binary
gdb ./snow-debug

# Set breakpoints and run
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run --help

# Examine the stack when stopped
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) info locals
```

### Python-Specific Debugging
```bash
# If Python debugging symbols are available
(gdb) py-bt        # Python backtrace
(gdb) py-list      # Show Python source
(gdb) py-locals    # Show Python variables
```

### Remote GDB Debugging
```bash
# On the Fedora system, start gdbserver
gdbserver :2345 ./snow-debug --help

# From your local machine
gdb ./dist/snow-debug/snow-debug
(gdb) target remote fedora-server.com:2345
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Disk Space Issues During Build

**Error:** `No space left on device (os error 28)` during Rust/Cargo build

**Cause:** The build process requires significant temporary space for Rust compilation.

**Solutions:**

#### 1. Check Available Disk Space
```bash
# Check overall disk usage
df -h

# Check /tmp directory specifically
df -h /tmp

# Check available space in home directory
df -h ~
```

#### 2. Clean Up Temporary Files
```bash
# Clean system temporary files
sudo rm -rf /tmp/cargo-install*
sudo rm -rf /tmp/rust*

# Clean user cargo cache
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/cache
rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/src
rm -rf ~/.cargo/git

# Clean hatch environments (if space is needed)
rm -rf ~/.local/share/hatch/env
```

#### 3. Use Alternative Temporary Directory
```bash
# Create a temporary directory in your home folder (usually has more space)
mkdir -p ~/tmp

# Set TMPDIR environment variable
export TMPDIR=~/tmp
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/tmp/cargo-target

# Then retry the build
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

#### 4. Free Up System Space
```bash
# Remove old kernels (Fedora)
sudo dnf remove $(dnf repoquery --installonly --latest-limit=-2 -q)

# Clean package cache
sudo dnf clean all

# Remove old logs
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks

# Clean user cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/*
```

#### 5. Build with Limited Parallelism
```bash
# Reduce parallel jobs to use less temporary space
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1

# Then retry the build
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

#### 6. Alternative: Build in Steps
```bash
# If still having issues, try building Rust separately first
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Clean and retry
cargo clean
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

### Memory Issues During Build (OOM Killer)

**Error:** `process didn't exit successfully` with `(signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)` during Rust compilation

**Cause:** The system ran out of memory and the OOM killer terminated the compiler process. Debug builds with full optimization are very memory-intensive.

**Solutions:**

#### 1. Check Memory Usage
```bash
# Check available memory
free -h

# Check current memory usage
top

# Monitor memory during build (in another terminal)
watch free -h
```

#### 2. Add Swap Space (if none exists)
```bash
# Check current swap
sudo swapon --show

# Create swap file if none exists (2GB example)
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Make permanent (optional)
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

#### 3. Reduce Compilation Memory Usage
```bash
# Set environment variables to reduce memory usage
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1              # Single-threaded compilation
export RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=1"      # Reduce optimization level
export PYAPP_DISTRIBUTION_EMBED=1      # Reduce PyApp memory usage

# Alternative: disable LTO to save memory
export RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=1 -C lto=off"

# Then retry the build
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

#### 4. Use Release Mode with Debug Symbols
```bash
# Build with less aggressive optimization but keep debug symbols
export RUSTFLAGS="-C opt-level=1 -C debuginfo=2 -C lto=off"
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1

cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

#### 5. Close Other Applications
```bash
# Free up memory by closing unnecessary applications
# Check what's using memory
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10

# Kill unnecessary processes if needed
```

#### 6. Alternative: Build on a Machine with More RAM
If your Fedora system has limited RAM (< 4GB), consider:
- Building on a machine with more memory
- Using a cloud instance with more RAM temporarily
- Building in a container with memory limits adjusted

#### 7. Monitor System Resources During Build
```bash
# In one terminal, start the build
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries

# In another terminal, monitor resources
watch 'free -h && echo "--- CPU ---" && top -bn1 | head -5'
```

### Architecture Mismatch Error

**Error:** `"not in executable format: file format not recognized"`

**Cause:** The binary was built on a different architecture (e.g., macOS ARM64) than your Fedora system (e.g., Linux x86_64).

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use build-remote to build on the target system
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh --build-remote user@fedora-server.com

# Or build manually on the Fedora system
ssh user@fedora-server.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
git clone https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-cli.git
cd snowflake-cli
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
```

**Check architectures:**
```bash
# Check your local architecture
uname -m

# Check remote system architecture
ssh user@fedora-server.com "uname -m"

# Check binary architecture
ssh user@fedora-server.com "file ~/snowflake-cli-debug/snow-debug"
```

### SSH Connection Issues
```bash
# Test SSH connection
ssh user@fedora-server.com "echo 'Connection successful'"

# Check SSH configuration
ssh -v user@fedora-server.com
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Ensure you have sudo access on the remote system
ssh user@fedora-server.com "sudo echo 'Sudo access confirmed'"
```

### SELinux Issues
```bash
# Check SELinux status
ssh user@fedora-server.com "getenforce"

# Temporarily disable if needed (for debugging only)
ssh user@fedora-server.com "sudo setenforce 0"
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Check system requirements
ssh user@fedora-server.com "dnf list installed | grep -E '(gcc|python3-devel|gdb)'"

# Manually install missing dependencies
ssh user@fedora-server.com "sudo dnf install -y gcc python3-devel gdb"
```

## üìö Environment Variables

The debug build supports these environment variables:

```bash
# Enable full Rust backtraces
export RUST_BACKTRACE=full

# Enable Python development mode
export PYTHONDEVMODE=1

# Enable CLI debug logging
export SNOWFLAKE_CLI_DEBUG=1
```

## üéØ Common Debug Scenarios

### Debugging CLI Commands
```bash
# Debug a specific command
gdb ./snow-debug
(gdb) run connection list --help
```

### Debugging Crashes
```bash
# Enable core dumps
ulimit -c unlimited

# Run the command that crashes
./snow-debug problematic-command

# Debug the core dump
gdb ./snow-debug core.*
```

### Debugging Hang/Freeze
```bash
# Attach to running process
./snow-debug command-that-hangs &
PID=$!
gdb -p $PID
```

## üìû Getting Help

### Check Setup Status
```bash
# Verify installation
ssh user@fedora-server.com "cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug && ./setup_fedora_debug.sh --help"

# Check debug binary
ssh user@fedora-server.com "file ~/snowflake-cli-debug/snow-debug"
```

### View Documentation

## üìù Examples

### Example 1: Basic Deployment (Build Remote)
```bash
# Deploy to a standard Fedora server and build there
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh --build-remote myuser@fedora.example.com

# SSH and debug
ssh myuser@fedora.example.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
gdb ./dist/snow-debug/snow-debug
```

### Example 2: Custom Configuration
```bash
# Deploy with custom SSH port and key
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh \
    --build-remote \
    -p 2222 \
    -k ~/.ssh/my-key \
    -d /opt/debug \
    myuser@fedora.example.com
```

### Example 3: Manual Build After Setup
```bash
# Deploy setup files only
./scripts/packaging/deploy_fedora_debug.sh \
    --setup-only \
    myuser@fedora.example.com

# SSH and build manually
ssh myuser@fedora.example.com
cd ~/snowflake-cli-debug
./setup_fedora_debug.sh
git clone https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-cli.git
cd snowflake-cli
hatch -e packaging run build-debug-binaries
gdb ./dist/snow-debug/snow-debug
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional debug build of the Snowflake CLI running on your remote Fedora system. üéâ
